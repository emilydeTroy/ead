<p style="color:#318eaf;">I am an artist who focuses on photography, collage, digital art, and book-making. I document what catches my attention through photography which encompasses human impacted spaces to mundane and everyday moments that are familiar, or universal, to the viewer but often get overlooked.  I use my other mediums to create whimsical, nostalgia-esque works. 
<br>
As an artist Iâ€™m intentional about the conditions in which I create depending upon my medium. For my books I plan, cut, fold, sew, and measure (and re-measure) whereas in my photography I have an initial plan (location, time of day, and lens)  but allow for spontaneity regarding subject matter.
<br>
Often I find myself in the role of the observer in the world and photography is a form in which I can relay my point of view and what shapes my world. Creating a variety of art allows me to participate in all the ways that are me.
